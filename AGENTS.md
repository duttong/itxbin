## Quick start
- This is a collection of utilities for several air sampling instruments (Gas Chromatographs)
- Mostly python3 code
- Preferred GUI library: PyQt5

- Abbreviations: 
    - LOGOS - The name of my group (Long-term Observations of Greenhouse gases and Ozone-depleting Substances)
      https://gml.noaa.gov/hats/
    - M4 - Fourth generation Mass Spectrometer (M1, M2, and M3 preceeded this instrument). Used to 
    measure descrete air samples from flasks or tanks.
    - FE3 - Third generation Flask Electron Capture Gas Chromatograph (preceeded by oldGC and OTTO)
    - PFP - Programmable flask package.

## How to work here
- Prefer small, focused changes.
- Keep public APIs stable unless explicitly requested.
- Add/adjust tests for behavior changes.
